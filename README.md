# Continuous Writing App üñäÔ∏è

This is a simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that encourages continuous writing. If you stop typing or interacting with the app for more than 5 seconds, all your text will be cleared automatically. A countdown timer in the top-right corner shows how much time you have left before the text is erased.

## Features

- **Continuous Writing Enforcement:** Text is deleted after 5 seconds of inactivity.
- **Live Countdown:** See a countdown timer showing seconds left before clearing.
- **Simple, Distraction-Free Interface:** Just a text box and a timer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

- The app tracks your last interaction (typing or clicking).
- If you don't interact for 5 seconds, the text area is cleared.
- The countdown timer resets every time you type or click in the text area.
